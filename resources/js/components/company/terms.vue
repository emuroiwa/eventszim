                                        Most venues have restricted items including but not limited to alcohol, weapons, cameras and glass bottles.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                        Tickets can be damaged by sunlight or heat.

                                        You must separate tickets from one another prior to arriving at the venue. No duplicate tickets will be issued to replace lost or stolen tickets.

                                    <li>

                                        The first person to enter the venue with a printed e-ticket or other hard ticket is the only person admitted by the ticket. Therefore do not share or duplicate the ticket, guard it like cash.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                        Any attempt to reproduce or duplicate the ticket will constitute fraud and will result in persecution in a court of law.
